- show number of images in largeDataset
- replace all references to directories in mat-image-grid-lib with references to public-api
- replace MatImageGridImageServiceBase with DataSourcePaged<T>
- update basic usage in readme.md with data source example
- make angular animation a dependency (in readme and as peer dependency of lib)

- make pig get image data from a paged data store not as an array with data of all images
  - reserve space im this.images, when starting requests (create sparse array by setting 'this.images.length') will prevent requesting multiple blocks from server with the same starting index and increasing length; but this will create holes in the images array.
  - scroll backwards with sparse images array: will it reload the images?
  - save memory by keeping only server data in memory and recreate ProgressiveImage objects, when they must be rendered?
  - remove images when no more needed to save memory (add option for size of buffer of images?)
